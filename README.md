# Individual-Assignment
The JavaScript interaction I created in the provided HTML code is designed to toggle the visibility of a "Kulliyyah" input field based on the selection of a "For kulliyyah based only" checkbox. This interaction ensures that the "Kulliyyah" input field is only displayed when the "For kulliyyah based only" checkbox is selected. I also add event listener to the checkbox.
